THIS README FILE DOCUMENTS AN ISSUE WITH ecartInversionGrid-NEIGHBOUR SEARCH (INSTABILITY)

In this ecart inversion grid, which is also presented as an example in the user manual and in 
doc/example_ecartInversionGrid/ (as of August 2016) (and certainly in other cases of inversion 
grids, too), for some cells not all neighbours are found correctly, for some cells not even one 
of the neighbours is found. The reason for that should be found in the numerical implementation 
of the search algorithm (possibly problems comparing floating point numbers).



executing the command: 
../../../bin/invgrid2vtk -igtype ecartInversionGrid -igpath ./ -igpar ecartInversionGrid_parfile_template -o invgrid_cells -all_nb
yields the following screen output:

The 5 inversion grid cells for which no neighbour was found (indices 306, 600, 1667, 2123, 2635) DO actually have neighbours!



As another example, the following list provides inversion grid cells for which only one neighbour was found (altough there
is more than one), the respective cell indices being given by the vtk file names :

executing the command: 
grep "CELLS            1 " invgrid_cells_nb*.vtk
yields a list of vtk neighbour files which only contain one vtk cell (i.e. one neighbour); the screen output is:

Looking into the above listed files (last entry in the files), we can see which neighbour cell was found 
(i.e. determine its cell index), maybe this will help you to find a starting point in debugging:
