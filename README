THIS IS A VERY SHORT DOCUMENTATION ON HOW TO GET
STARTED WITH

    A S K I  - version 1.2

####################################################

ASKI and some of its components, as well as documentation and some examples
are available on https://github.com/seismology-RUB/ASKI .
Please find contact addresses on https://github.com/seismology-RUB, or visit 
http://www.rub.de/aski in case you want to get in touch with the authors. If you 
encounter any problems installing or using the software, it will be helpful to 
open (or add to) an "issues" topic on https://github.com/seismology-RUB/ASKI .

The main authors are Florian Schumacher (Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany)
and Wolfgang Friederich (Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany), 2016.

DOCUMENTATION
##########
Please refer to documents in ASKI/doc/ :
- the ASKI user manual (ASKI_manual.pdf)
- Florian Schumacher's doctoral dissteration about waveform sensitivity kernels and the modularized 
  iterative full waveform inversion concept on which ASKI is based (dissertation_florian_schumacher.pdf)
- the accepted version of our GJI 2016 paper, re-typeset in a standard layout (ASKI_paper_gji_2016.pdf)


##########
REQUIREMENTS
##########
GNU Make
Fortran compiler (sufficient standard) (so far tested: GNU Fortran (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.2) 5.4.0 20160609) ,
BLAS and LAPACK  libraries for all applications ,
BLACKS, SCALAPACK and MPI libraries optionally for few parallel applications (e.g. available via <http://www.netlib.org/>)


##########
INSTALLATION
##########
0) You should already have been successful in downloading the source code of the ASKI main package by either
   + cloning the master branch of the ASKI repository on gitHub.com:
     git clone --depth 1 --branch master https://github.com/seismology-RUB/ASKI
   + or downloading a zipped version of the source code from there;
     wget https://github.com/seismology-RUB/ASKI/archive/master.zip
   The directory to where you have cloned, extracted the master branch, will in the following be referred to as ASKI/

1) Adjust the software to your system and personal requirements by:
   + setting the variables COMPILER, MPICOMPILER in file ASKI/Makefile appropriately
   + setting the variables BLAS, LAPACK, (BLACS, SCALAPACK, MPILIB) in file ASKI/Makefile in order to correctly bind the libraries
   + adjusting the variable FFLAGS in file ASKI/Makefile , if required

2) Run command "make all" in ASKI/ to compile all serial programs (nearly all functionality)

3) Run command "make parallel" in ASKI/ to compile all parallel programs (two optional linear system solvers which run in parallel)

Now ASKI/bin should contain all binaries and no error should have occurred (at best...).

USAGE
