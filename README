ASKI and some of its components, as well as documentation and some examples
are available via http://www.rub.de/aski
Please also refer to this address in case you want to get in touch with the
authors, who are very eager on any feedback, especially about problems you may 
encounter installing or using the software.

REQUIREMENTS
##########
GNU Make
Fortran compiler (sufficient standard) (so far tested: GNU Fortran (Ubuntu 5.2.1-22ubuntu2) 5.2.1 20151010)
BLAS and LAPACK  libraries for all applications ,
BLACKS, SCALAPACK and MPI libraries optionally for few parallel applications (e.g. available via <http://www.netlib.org/>)


##########
INSTALLATION
##########
0) Extract the directory ASKI_1.1 containing all files and subdirectories to some path,
   if not done yet

1) Adjust the software to your system and personal requirements by:
   + setting the variables COMPILER, MPICOMPILER in file ASKI_1.1/Makefile appropriately
   + setting the variables BLAS, LAPACK, (BLACS, SCALAPACK, MPILIB) in file ASKI_1.1/Makefile in order to correctly bind the libraries
   + adjusting the variable FFLAGS in file ASKI_1.1/Makefile , if required

2) Run command "make all" in ASKI_1.1/ to compile all serial programs (nearly all functionality)

3) Run command "make parallel" in ASKI_1.1/ to compile all parallel programs (two optional linear system solvers which run in parallel)

Now ASKI_1.1/bin should contain all binaries and no error should have occurred (at best...).

USAGE
