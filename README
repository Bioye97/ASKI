##########
REQUIREMENTS
##########
Unix-like operating system (?!), so far only run on GNU Linux Debian 4.7.2-5
GNU Make
Fortran compiler (sufficient standard) (so far only tested: GNU Fortran (Debian 4.7.2-5) 4.7.2)
BLAS, LAPACK, BLACKS, SCALAPACK libraries (available via <http://www.netlib.org/>)


##########
INSTALLATION
##########
0) Extract the directory ASKI_0.3 containing all files/subdirectories of the ASKI code to some directory,
   if not done yet

1) Adjust the software to your system and personal requirements by:
   + setting the variables SHELL and FFLAGS in file ASKI_0.3/Makefile to desired values
   + setting the variables BLAS, LAPACK, BLACS and SCALAPACK in file ASKI_0.3/Makefile in order to correctly bind the libraries
   + setting environment variable 'F95' to the name of your compiler

2) Run command "make clean" in ASKI_0.3/

3) Compile all binaries by running "make all" in ASKI_0.3/

Now ASKI_0.3/bin should contain all binaries and no error should have occurred (at best...).
