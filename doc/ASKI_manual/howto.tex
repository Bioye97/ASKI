Only chapter Guide (page~\pageref{guide}) is intended to be read through which, for this reason, is held as compact 
as possible. This chapter may itself be regarded as ``the manual'', with the appending chapters only 
containing more specific detail on processes or objects which chapter Guide refers to.
After all, the very modular character of \ASKI{} requires documentation which itself is modular.

In other words: just start reading the respective section of chapter Guide, which you are interested in 
and whenever you feel the need for more detail follow the respective references. This way, we try to focus
the user on necessary information and successfully guide through the lot of details contained in this document. 

When you conduct a specific \ASKI{} operation for the first time, we recommend you to first fully read through the 
respective guiding list and the referred basic steps before you start running any programs. This way you will 
get an impression of the repuirements for your operation.

All chapters appending chapter Guide are not intended to be read through section by section but may well
serve the user as a reference. Especially section~\myref{programs_scripts,sec:bin_prog} can provide the 
experienced user with additional executables that conduct some more features which are not referenced somewhere
in the document.
