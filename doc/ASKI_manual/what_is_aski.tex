\ASKI{} is a modularized software package written by the main authors Florian Schumacher and
Wolfgang Friederich (Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany). It offers sensitivity and regularization 
analysis tools for seismic datasets
as well as a scattering-integral-type full waveform inversion (FWI) concept based on waveform sensitivity 
kernels (i.e.\ Fr\'echet derivatives of seismic waveform data functionals) derived from Born scattering theory,
having Gauss-Newton convergence properties.
This inversion concept is presented in our 2016 GJI paper \cite{Schumacher16} and in Florian's doctoral
dissertation \cite{_743d334d-dfa4-4a16-8cc5-91cdadc95271}. The software package \ASKI{} itself is presented
in our 2016 SoftwareX paper \cite{Schumacher16b}.

\ASKI{} does not implement an intrinsic code for simulation of seismic wave propagation in order to 
solve the seismic forward problem, but instead provides generalized interfaces to different external wave 
propagation codes. At the moment, the 1D semi-analytical code Gemini \cite{friederich_wd1995} and the 3D spectral 
element code SPECFEM3D \cite{TrKoLi08} are supported in \emph{both}, Cartesian and spherical framework. 
Additionally \ASKI{} supports the 3D nodal discontinuous Galerkin code NEXD \cite{Lambrecht.2015}
and we plan to implement support for the Finite Difference code SOFI \cite{bohlen2002parallel}
in the future. 
Please do not hesitate to add your own forward code (refer to the \ASKI{} developers manual in
\lcode{devel/doc/ASKI_developers_manual/}). If you encounter any problems or have suggestions to improve this
process, we are happy to hear from you.

The resulting very modular concept of \ASKI{} allows us to keep the spatial description of the inverted 
models completely independent of the spatial description of the model used for solving the forward 
problem. This way, the overall inverse problem can be approached and regularized more physically compared
with using the forward grid for inversion, too. The normally very fine spatial discretization of the model
domain is employed by the forward solver. This discretization is usually weigh too fine to be used
directly for inversion since usually seismic data can only resolve much coarser structures and the
resolving power the data possesses also varies throughout the model domain. 
The separation concept of \ASKI{} \emph{naturally} alows to choose the spatial model
resolution heterogeneously and \emph{anew} in each iteration of FWI.

Instead of using time-dependent values of ground motion (i.e.\ samples of time-serieses of seismic data), 
\ASKI{} uses freqency-dependent complex values of ground displacement, recorded at certain receivers excited 
by certain seismic sources. This, mainly, has reasons of computational feasibility.
For time-domain forward methods, we implement an on-the-fly Fourier Transform in order to provide the
required spectral waveforms. 

Using sensitivity kernels $K$, data residuals $\delta d_i$ are connected to model uptdate values $\delta m_j$ by 
an integral relation $\delta d_i = \int_{\text{Earth}} \delta \vec{m} \cdot \vec{K}_i$. In order to build a linear 
system, the model update $\delta \vec{m}$ is assumed to be constant throughout small scattering volumes 
$\Omega_j$, where $\Omega = \overset{\centerdot}{\bigcup}_j \Omega_j$. These volumes constitute the cells of the volumetric 
inversion grid and the sensitivity matrix contains entries of preintegrated kernels $\int_{\Omega_j} K_i$ (and
model update values $\delta m_j$ are associated with cells $\Omega_j$ for a particular elastic parameter).

The sensitivity kernels $K$ are computed from forward wavefields and strains produced on a set of points in 
space, which
is dependent on the particular forward method. This set of points is refered to in \ASKI{} as 
\emph{wavefield points}. The 
wavefields are written to file, by the respective forward method, which may require large disk space. 
Providing methods for constructing quadrature rules for arbitrary point sets contained in 
arbitrary (hexahedral or tetrahedral) volumes, 
\ASKI{} computes integration weights for integration of functions given on the wavefield points 
(particularly kernels) over the volumetric
cells of the inversion grid. The inversion grid takes care of the localization of wavefield points 
inside the inversion grid cells and, if requested, the transformation of cells to a hexahedral (or tetrahedral) 
standard 
cell for the computation of the integration weights. Hence, exotic combinations of wavefield points (i.e.\ 
forward methods), integration weight types and inversion grid types might not be possible (e.g.\ using the
\lcode{SPECFEM}-internal inversion grid built by the spectral elements along with wavefield points from 
another forward method). 

The pre-integrated kernel values are also written to files, which may be flexibly read in 
(e.g.\ reading in kernels of specific data subsets only)
by the sets of independent \ASKI{} executables conducting any sensitivity analysis 
or interation steps in the iterative full waveform inversion.
Those tools work on the sensitivity matrix, which in the FWI is used in a linear system of equations which
relates data residua $\delta d_i$ to a model improvement $\delta m$. 
In the course of the iterative full waveform inversion, it is naturally possible by \ASKI{} to gradually increase
the frequency content of the inverted data and to choose smaller inversion grid cells in each iteration, 
i.e.\ increasing the spatial resolution dependent on frequency.
