There can be arbitrary (documenting) header lines before the blocks.

The first line starting with 'MODEL VALUES' or 'DATA SAMPLES' is interpreted as the 
starting line of a block.  Inside a block, there must NOT be unexpected lines!


MODEL VALUES
INVERSION_GRID_CELLS SPECIFIC
PARAMETERS SPECIFIC
ncells
icell_1
nparam param_1 ... param_n
...
icell_n
nparam param_1 ... param_n


There can be arbitrary (documenting) lines between the blocks.


DATA SAMPLES
WEIGHTING NONE
PATHS SPECIFIC
COMPONENTS SPECIFIC
FREQUENCIES SPECIFIC
IMRE SPECIFIC
npaths
evID_1 staname_1 
ncomp comp_1...comp_n 
nfreq ifreq_1 ... ifreq_n
nimre imre_1 ... imre_n
...
evID_n staname_n
ncomp comp_1...comp_n 
nfreq ifreq_1 ... ifreq_n
nimre imre_1 ... imre_n


There can be arbitrary (documenting) lines after the blocks.

It does not matter which block comes first (DATA SAMPLE or MODEL VALUES).
