#  PARAMETER FILE FOR EXTERNAL CARTESIAN INVERSION GRID
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  HOWTO USE THE PARAMETER FILE:
#
# comment lines, STARTING with "#" are ignored
# empty lines and lines containing blanks only are ignored
# lines not containing "=" are ignored
#
# specify one parameter per line, valid lines having the form "keyword = value"
# (blanks leading or following the keyword, the "=", or the value are ignored)
#
# in a non comment line, all characters in front of "=" (without leading and appending blanks)
# are interpreted as the keyword, allowing for blank characters within the keyword (e.g. for lines  "   key word = value   ",
# the string "key word" is used as the keyword)
# all characters behind "=" (without leading and appending blanks) are interpreted as the value string from 
# which the value is read, which in particular means that "#" comments at the end of a line (such as 
# " keyword = value  # comment ") are NOT allowed (in the latter case, the string "value  # comment" would be used
# to read a value from)
#
# by ASKI convention, specify PATHS (i.e. directory names, which will be 
# concatenated with a filename of a file in that directory) always ending on '/'
# specify FILENAMES always WITHOUT leading '/'
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  WHAT IS A SPECFEM3D INVERSION GRID?
#
# Use the specfem3d for ASKI main file generated by specfem3d-for-ASKI using ASKI_type_inversion_grid = 4,
# which contains wavefield points for complete elements (all GLL points, in fact)
# and they are stored in order as handled in specfem. Furthermore their values of jacobian can be read from that
# main file. 
# This inversion grid only works, if the very same specfem3dForASKI main file (!) is used for (specfem type!) wavefield points!
# This means, that this type of inversion grid is created ONLY to be used along with METHOD = SPECFEM3D, obviously.
# The specfem3dInversionGrid may also be used with integration weights of types other than type 6 (specfem3d 
# integration weights), but it is recommended to use type 6 integration weights when using specfem3d inversion
# grid.
# The vtk cell geometry point information is taken from the wavefield points (GLL points) coordinates and the
# localization of wavefield points (GLL pointe) inside the cells is trivial (as all GLL points contained in a 
# cell are assumed in a row)

#  COORDINATE SPECIFICATIONS FOR VTK FILE OUTPUT
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Select the geometry type. VTK_GEOMETRY_TYPE is one of:
#   'CELLS'          data on inversion grids will be written on the volumetric inversion grid CELLS (hexahedral) to vtk files (as 'UNSTRUCTURED_GRID' datasets) -> intuitive volumetric view
#   'CELL_CENTERS'   data on inversion grids will be written on the cell center POINTS to vtk files (as 'POLYDATA' datasets) -> smaller files, better to apply filters in ParaView
#
  VTK_GEOMETRY_TYPE = CELLS

#  Scale vtk geometry coordinates by factor VTK_COORDS_SCALING_FACTOR, if SCALE_VTK_COORDS = .True.
#  this may be helpful if coordinate values (e.g. in m) get so large that they cause problems in paraview
#
  SCALE_VTK_COORDS = .False.
  VTK_COORDS_SCALING_FACTOR = 1.

#  in case of using SPECFEM3D_GLOBE, define here the maximum radius [km] of the sphere, by which Earth is approximated
#  (only used to interpret "depth" and "altitude" of events and stations when plotting to vtk files, this is
#  ignored for SPECFEM3D_Cartesian applications)
   SPECFEM3D_R_EARTH_KM = 6371.0
