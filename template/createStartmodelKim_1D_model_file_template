the 1D model file expected by program createStartmodelKim must have the following format:
  line 1:   nval  ncol
     nval = number of model values /interpolation coordinates to come
     ncol = number of columns to read from file, ncol=1+N, where N is number of parameters
  line 2:   icoord  param1 ... paramN
     icoord = index of inversion grid / wavefield point coordinate for which the interpolation
              should be applied (either 1,2 or 3)
     param1 ... paramN   N parameter names associated with the values in the columns below
  lines 3...nval+2 :   coord val1 ... valN
     these following nval lines contain the interpolation coordinate and N model values for the
     respective parameters, as defined by line 2
     The values 'coord' are assumed to be be strictly monotonical(!) and can be either increasing
     or decreasing. You may choose this monotonicity at your will dependent on the coordinate for
     which the interpolation should be done (which, dependent on your inversion grid type may be
     depth or positive z-value...)

as in total 2+nval lines are read from this file, everything below (such as this comment block)
is ignored
