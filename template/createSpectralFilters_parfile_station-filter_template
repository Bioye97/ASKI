#  PARAMETER FILE FOR PROGRAM createSpectralFilters to generate station filters
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  HOWTO USE THE PARAMETER FILE:
#
# comment lines, STARTING with "#" are ignored
# empty lines and lines containing blanks only are ignored
# lines not containing "=" are ignored
#
# specify one parameter per line, valid lines having the form "keyword = value"
# (blanks leading or following the keyword, the "=", or the value are ignored)
#
# in a non comment line, all characters in front of "=" (without leading and appending blanks)
# are interpreted as the keyword, allowing for blank characters within the keyword (e.g. for lines  "   key word = value   ",
# the string "key word" is used as the keyword)
# all characters behind "=" (without leading and appending blanks) are interpreted as the value string from 
# which the value is read, which in particular means that "#" comments at the end of a line (such as 
# " keyword = value  # comment ") are NOT allowed (in the latter case, the string "value  # comment" would be used
# to read a value from)
#
# by ASKI convention, specify PATHS (i.e. directory names, which will be 
# concatenated with a filename of a file in that directory) always ending on '/'
# specify FILENAMES always WITHOUT leading '/'
