#  PARAMETER FILE FOR INVERSION "your_name_of_inversion"
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  HOWTO USE THE PARAMETER FILE:
#
# comment lines, STARTING with "#" are ignored
# empty lines and lines containing blanks only are ignored
# lines not containing "=" are ignored
#
# specify one parameter per line, valid lines having the form "keyword = value"
# (blanks leading or following the keyword, the "=", or the value are ignored)
#
# in a non comment line, all characters in front of "=" (without leading and appending blanks)
# are interpreted as the keyword, allowing for blank characters within the keyword (e.g. for lines  "   key word = value   ",
# the string "key word" is used as the keyword)
# all characters behind "=" (without leading and appending blanks) are interpreted as the value string from 
# which the value is read, which in particular means that "#" comments at the end of a line (such as 
# " keyword = value  # comment ") are NOT allowed (in the latter case, the string "value  # comment" would be used
# to read a value from)
#
# by ASKI convention, specify PATHS (i.e. directory names, which will be 
# concatenated with a filename of a file in that directory) always ending on '/'
# specify FILENAMES always WITHOUT leading '/'

#  Paths where ASKI finds files related to the measured data as expected (text files containing complex numbers
#  in assumed frequency discretization as defined below).
#  These paths can be everywhere, e.g. close to where you have stored/processed your (time domain) data, 
#  or in directory MAIN_PATH_INVERSION, etc. ...
#  The flags APPLY_EVENT_FILTER, APPLY_STATION_FILTER control whether to apply any filters at all (if .false.

#  FILE_MEASURED_DATA: will by convention be: data_EVENTID_STATIONNAME_COMP
#  FILE_EVENT_FILTER: will by convention be: filter_EVENTID
#  FILE_STATION_FILTER: will by convention be: filter_STATIONNAME_COMP , filters are dependet on component
#  where STATIONNAME and EVENTID are defined in FILE_STATION_LIST and FILE_EVENT_LIST file, and COMP is a

#  DEFINITION OF EVENTS AND STATIONS
#  FILE_EVENT_LIST is an absolute filename where ASKI finds a text file of the following format:
#    - first line contains single character 'C' or 'S', defining the coordinate system ('C'artesian or 'S'pherical)
#      with respect to which the given event coordinates lat,lon are interpreted
#    - each following non-empty line of the file is interpreted as a definition of one event and must 
#      contain the following space-separated values:
#       + eventid     13 character name, (e.g. 2006.10.2977 or 061113_141238) should NOT contain whitespace!
#       + origintime  characters of form yyyymmdd_hhmmss_nnnnnnnnn or yyyymmdd_hhmmss 
#                     (i.e. with or without nano-seconds), e.g. 20130320_170012 or 20130320_170002_718000000
#       + lat         latitude in degrees, -90 <= lat <= 90 ('S') or first coordinate in 
#                     wavefield points / inversion grid - frame ('C') ->  read the manual on inversion grid definitions
#       + lon         longitude in degrees, 0 <= lon <= 360 ('S') or second  coordinate in 
#                     wavefield points / inversion grid -frame ('C') (read manual)
#       + depth       source depth in km ('S'), or third coordinate in wavefield points / inversion grid -frame ('C') (read manual)
#       + typ         source type:  0 = force, 1 = moment tensor, -1: not specified
#       + mag         factor on source mechanism
#       + mom/frce    either 3 values (force vector) or 6 values (moment tensor)
#  FILE_STATION_LIST is of analogous format, where a station is defined by a line containing the values:
#   + station_name    5 character name, which should NEITHER contain whitespace NOR underscors '_' !
#   + network_code    6 character network code
#   + lat             latitude in degrees, -90 <= lat <= 90 ('S') or first coordinate in 
#                     wavefield points / inversion grid - frame ('C') ->  read the manual on inversion grid definitions
#   + lon             longitude in degrees, 0 <= lon <= 360 ('S') or second  coordinate in 
#                     wavefield points / inversion grid -frame ('C') (read manual)
#   + elevation       altitude of station ('S'), or third coordinate in wavefield points / inversion grid -frame ('C') (read manual)

#  discretized frequency window of measured data (and event_filter / station_filter !) given by a frequency 
#  step FREQUENCY_STEP [Hz] and a vector of frequency indices INDEX_OF_FREQ (of length NUMBER_OF_FREQ), where 
#  for specific frequency index i the corresponding frequency f_i [Hz] computes to 
#
#    f_i = i * FREQUENCY_STEP
#
#  EXAMPLE:
#      FREQUENCY_STEP = 10.
#      NUMBER_OF_FREQ = 5
#      INDEX_OF_FREQ = 2 3 5 7 10
#
#  this defines a set of the 5 discrete frequencies:  20.[Hz], 30.[Hz], 50.[Hz], 70.[Hz], 100.[Hz]

#  Indicate the unit factor of the measured data. The definition of the factor is:
#  Multiplication of the measured data (displacement) with this factor gives values in the SI unit of meters [m].
#  EXAMPLE: If you use seismic time-domain data for ASKI in the unit of nano meters [nm], then UNIT_FACTOR_MEASURED_DATA
#  must be set to 1.0e-9 , because the data values in nano meters [nm] must be divided by 1.0e9 in order to get meters [m].
#  If you use seismic displacement data in the SI unit of meters, then UNIT_FACTOR_MEASURED_DATA must be set to 1.0
#
  UNIT_FACTOR_MEASURED_DATA = 1.0
