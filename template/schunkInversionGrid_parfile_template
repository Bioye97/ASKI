#  PARAMETER FILE FOR Spherical Chunk Inversion Grid (schunkInversionGrid)
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  HOWTO USE THE PARAMETER FILE:
#
# comment lines, STARTING with "#" are ignored
# empty lines and lines containing blanks only are ignored
# lines not containing "=" are ignored
#
# specify one parameter per line, valid lines having the form "keyword = value"
# (blanks leading or following the keyword, the "=", or the value are ignored)
#
# in a non comment line, all characters in front of "=" (without leading and appending blanks)
# are interpreted as the keyword, allowing for blank characters within the keyword 
# (e.g. for lines  "   key word = value   ", the string "key word" is used as the keyword)
# all characters behind "=" (without leading and appending blanks) are interpreted as the value string from 
# which the value is read, which in particular means that "#" comments at the end of a line (such as 
# " keyword = value  # comment ") are NOT allowed (in the latter case, the string "value  # comment" would be used
# to read a value from)
#
# by ASKI convention, specify PATHS (i.e. directory names, which will be 
# concatenated with a filename of a file in that directory) always ending on '/'
# specify FILENAMES always WITHOUT leading '/'

# The spherical chunk inversion grid is derived from a simple planar cartesian
# grid by projection of each grid plane onto a spherical shell, assuming that
# the cartesian grid plane touches the spherical shell at its center.
# Since cells have uniform size in the planar cartesian grid plane, cells
# on the spherical shell become successively smaller with distance from the 
# center of the spherical chunk. Radially, the inversion grid may consist of
# several layer blocks each of which may have its own cell size.
# To describe points in the spherical chunk, we either use LOCAL cartesian coordinates
# with the center of the chunk at x=y=0 and z=r, or GLOBAL cartesian coordinates
# with z pointing towards the north pole, x pointing towards the equator at lon=0
# and y pointing towards the equator at lon=90.
# The center of the chunk may be shifted to any place on the sphere and, in addition,
# may be rotated counterclockwise around its local vertical.

#  COORDINATE SPECIFICATIONS FOR VTK FILE OUTPUT
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Customizing the VTK output:
#
# VTK_PROJECTION is one of:
#   'GLOBAL'      center of chunk in CLAT, CLON, with applied SCHUNK_INVGRID_ROT
#   'LOCAL_CURV'  center of chunk in x=y=0, NO SCHUNK_INVGRID_ROT applied, but with curvature
#   'LOCAL_FLAT'  center of chunk in x=y=0, NO SCHUNK_INVGRID_ROT applied, NO curvature, i.e. projection of each depth onto the tangential x-y-plane
#   'LOCAL_NORTH_CURV'  same as 'LOCAL_CURV', but WITH SCHUNK_INVGRID_ROT applied, i.e. x really points to south
#   'LOCAL_NORTH_FLAT'  same as 'LOCAL_FLAT', but WITH SCHUNK_INVGRID_ROT applied, i.e. x really points to south
#
  VTK_PROJECTION = GLOBAL

# Select the geometry type. VTK_GEOMETRY_TYPE is one of:
#   'CELLS'          data on inversion grids will be written on the volumetric inversion grid CELLS (hexahedral) to vtk files (as 'UNSTRUCTURED_GRID' datasets) -> intuitive volumetric view
#   'CELL_CENTERS'   data on inversion grids will be written on the cell center POINTS to vtk files (as 'POLYDATA' datasets) -> smaller files, better to apply filters in ParaView
#
  VTK_GEOMETRY_TYPE = CELLS

# Scale all VTK point coordinates by an additional factor
# if SCALE_VTK_COORDS = .false., then VTK_COORDS_SCALING_FACTOR is ignored
#
  SCALE_VTK_COORDS = .false.
