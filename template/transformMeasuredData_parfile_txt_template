#  PARAMETER FILE FOR PROGRAM createMeasuredData
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  HOWTO USE THE PARAMETER FILE:
#
# comment lines, STARTING with "#" are ignored
# empty lines and lines containing blanks only are ignored
# lines not containing "=" are ignored
#
# specify one parameter per line, valid lines having the form "keyword = value"
# (blanks leading or following the keyword, the "=", or the value are ignored)
#
# in a non comment line, all characters in front of "=" (without leading and appending blanks)
# are interpreted as the keyword, allowing for blank characters within the keyword (e.g. for lines  "   key word = value   ",
# the string "key word" is used as the keyword)
# all characters behind "=" (without leading and appending blanks) are interpreted as the value string from 
# which the value is read, which in particular means that "#" comments at the end of a line (such as 
# " keyword = value  # comment ") are NOT allowed (in the latter case, the string "value  # comment" would be used
# to read a value from)
#
# by ASKI convention, specify PATHS (i.e. directory names, which will be 
# concatenated with a filename of a file in that directory) always ending on '/'
# specify FILENAMES always WITHOUT leading '/'

#  Path where all txt trace files can be found (must end on '/').
#  The trace files in that path are expected to have filenames of form 
#  EVID_STANAME_COMP.txt

#  dataModelSpaceInfo text file defining the set of data samples for which the conversion will be done:
#  For all present receiver components of all present data paths, the complete spectrum will be generated
#  as defined by global frequency discretization from main parfile.
#  I.e. any specific frequency definition in the data model space info file will be ignored.
#
  FILE_DATA_MODEL_SPACE_INFO = data_model_space_info_all
 

#  Global time discretization (timestep and number of samples) for ALL txt trace files.
#  If some of your data have other time discretizations than others, you would need to 
#  re-run this program for each time discretization, properly re-defining the data subset 
#  through the data_model_space_info file.
#
  DT = 8.8e-05
  NSTEP = 2816


#  The integer value COLUMN_OF_TRACE defines the column of the txt trace files in which the actual time-series
#  is found (e.g. if the files contain the time as first column and amplitude values as second column, set
#  COLUMN_OF_TRACE = 2; if only one column with amplitude values is contained in the files, set COLUMN_OF_TRACE = 1)
#
   COLUMN_OF_TRACE = 2
