# ASKI main package version 1.0

Authors: Florian Schumacher and Wolfgang Friederich, Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany, 2015.

The files in this repository (except this file [README.md](README.md), file 
[doc/ASKI_manual_1-0_dec-2015.pdf](doc/ASKI_manual_1-0_dec-2015.pdf) and subdirectory [doc/ASKI_manual/](doc/ASKI_manual)) 
were originally provided in a directory `ASKI_1.0/` that was packed to `ASKI_1.0.tar.gz` and provided for download on 
[http://www.rub.de/aski](http://www.rub.de/aski). Keept this in mind, whenever you read something like `ASKI_1.0/` etc.
in the [README](README) or the [ASKI manual](doc/ASKI_manual_1-0_dec-2015.pdf).

Originally, the ASKI pdf user manual, as well its LaTeX source, were provided *separately* of the ASKI main source code 
package on [http://www.rub.de/aski](http://www.rub.de/aski) as `ASKI_manual_1.0_dec-2015.tar.gz`. The directory
`ASKI_manual_1.0_dec-2015/' contained in `ASKI_manual_1.0_dec-2015.tar.gz` is here renamed as `ASKI_manual/` and added
to [doc/](doc) for completeness.
