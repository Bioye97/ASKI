# ASKI main package version 1.1

Authors: Florian Schumacher and Wolfgang Friederich, Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany, 2016.

The files in this repository (except this file [README.md](README.md), file 
[doc/ASKI_manual_1-1_mar-2016.pdf](doc/ASKI_manual_1-1_mar-2016.pdf) and subdirectory [doc/ASKI_manual/](doc/ASKI_manual)) 
were originally provided in a directory `ASKI_1.1/` that was packed to `ASKI_1.1.tar.gz` and provided for download on 
[http://www.rub.de/aski](http://www.rub.de/aski). Keept this in mind, whenever you read something like `ASKI_1.1/` etc.
in the [README](README) or the [ASKI manual](doc/ASKI_manual_1-1_mar-2016.pdf).

Originally, the ASKI pdf user manual, as well its LaTeX source, were provided *separately* of the ASKI main source code 
package on [http://www.rub.de/aski](http://www.rub.de/aski) as `ASKI_manual_1.1_mar-2016.tar.gz`. The directory
`ASKI_manual_1.1_mar-2016/` contained in `ASKI_manual_1.1_mar-2016.tar.gz` is here renamed as `ASKI_manual/` and added
to [doc/](doc) for completeness.
