# ASKI main package version 0.3

Authors: Florian Schumacher and Wolfgang Friederich, Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany, 2013.

The files in this repository (except this file [README.md](README.md) and subdirectory [doc/](doc)) were originally provided 
in a directory `ASKI_0.3/` that was packed to `ASKI_0.3.tar.gz` and provided for download on 
[http://www.rub.de/aski](http://www.rub.de/aski). Keept this in mind, whenever you read something like `ASKI_0.3/` etc.
in the [README](README) or the [ASKI manual](doc/ASKI_manual.pdf).

Originally, the ASKI pdf user manual, as well its LaTeX source, were provided *separately* of the ASKI main source code 
package on [http://www.rub.de/aski](http://www.rub.de/aski). Here, it added as subdirectory [doc/](doc) for completeness.
